TOP SECRET ALGORITHM
● If the length of the shipment's destination street name is even, the base suitability score (SS) is the number of vowels in the driver’s name multiplied by 1.5.
● If the length of the shipment's destination street name is odd, the base SS is the number of consonants in the driver’s name multiplied by 1.
● If the length of the shipment's destination street name shares any common factors (besides 1) with the length of the driver’s name, the SS is increased by 50% above the base SS.
